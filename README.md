# About this configuration:

- UltiSnips snippets should be stored in ~/.config/nvim
- pynvim is required (pip install pynvim).
- lazy.nvim is used for managing packages. See [folke/lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).
- I am primarily updating this for **Mac**. I will cherry-pick commits over to
  the windows version, however I will not be comprehensively testing it.
- nvim-cmp is used for completion. See [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp).

My goal is to keep this configuration relatively simple. Some inconsistencies may arise
due to adding language support, but I want to avoid needing to memorize too many external
keybinds.
